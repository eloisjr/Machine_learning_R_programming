# Build a Machine Learning Model in R programming 

# Project

This is a final project from a Diploma course called "High Specialty Certificate in Data Science" from Tecnológico de Monterrey University, Mexico.

# Context 

A company has several machines and jobs to do.

• Each job has a set of activities that must be done in a specific order
• Activities must be carried out on specific machines
• The scheduling of activities is done daily

# Problem

Three computer systems solve scheduling. They all provide valid solutions, although not at the same time (and vary depending on each particular problem).

• The company pays for computing time, so a solution obtained quickly is desirable

• The fastest method is not always the same. Then, sometimes the company "overpays" for a solution that could have been obtained with less computing time. 

# Dataset

The image below shows the data information available.

# Business Goal 

• The company wants to save money by selecting the method (of the three available) that minimizes computing time.

• In addition to the solution proposal, convincing managers that the solution is viable requires an estimate of how much Computing time would be saved with the proposed solution.
